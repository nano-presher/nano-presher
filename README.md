### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Pascal from Freiberg in Saxony, Germany. I have studied Nanotechnology and am now a PhD Student at RWTH Aachen University and Infineon Technologies in the topic of silicon based scaleable quantum technologies. I am interested in data science and software engineering.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a *waferplot library* project.
- ðŸŒ± I'm currently learning and working with *CI / CD* in GitHub and GitLab.
- I am highly interested in coding rust (interfacing it with python, e.g. with py03) 
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about *python, matlab, data analysis*
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/muster-pascal/)
- âš¡ Fun fact: It takes a photon up to 40,000 years to travel from the core of the sun to its surface, but only 8 minutes to travel the rest of the way to Earth ...
