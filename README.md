### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Pascal from Freiberg in Saxony, Germany. I have studied Nanotechnology and am now a PhD Student at RWTH Aachen University and Infineon Technologies in the topic of silicon based scaleable quantum technologies. I am interested in data science and software engineering.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a *waferplot library* project.
- ðŸŒ± I want to learn *CI / CD within github*
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about *python, matlab, data analysis*
